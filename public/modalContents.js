    <p>IV contrast enhanced CT scan is the gold standard for detecting intraabdominal injury, providing
        there are no contraindications, and the patient is not hemodynamically compromised, or is
        responsive to ongoing resuscitation</p>

    <p>The child must be stable enough to go to the CT scanner – with or without ongoing resuscitation
    </p>

    <p>Local capacity to safely do the scan is needed </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The child must be accompanied to the CT scanner by appropriate medical and nursing personnel
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>Consider CT scan if splenic injury or other intraabdominal injury is suspected or cannot be
        excluded based on your evaluation, including factors such as:</p>

    <uL>
        <li>There has been haemodynamic compromise, responsive to resuscitation, or Hct has fallen with
            no other obvious explanation</li>
        <li>There is abdominal tenderness, distention, bruising or signs of peritonitis</li>
        <li>There is macroscopic haematuria</li>
        <li>The ALT is elevated 3 times above normal</li>
        <li>The pelvic x-ray shows findings of pelvic trauma (fracture +/- dislocation)</li>
        <li>e-FAST scan is positive</li>
        <li>Traumatic brain injury is present making abdominal assessment difficult</li>
        <li>Significant thoracic injury is suspected</li>
        <li>Injury mechanism is concerning</li>
    </uL>

    <p>NB: CT findings alone do not dictate the need for intervention for solid organ injury including
        the spleen. This includes the spleen injury grade, and presence of contrast blush,
        pseudoaneurysm, and haemoperitoneum. Decisions about angioemolisation
